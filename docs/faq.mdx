# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This page answers common questions about Wiredoor, how it works, and how to troubleshoot basic setup or usage issues.

---

### Do I need a public IP to use Wiredoor?

Yes — the **Wiredoor Server** must be deployed on a machine with a **public IP address** or publicly reachable domain so it can receive traffic from the internet and connect to remote nodes.

---

### Do my services need public IPs?

No — your **internal services do not need to be publicly accessible**. Wiredoor connects to them through a reverse VPN tunnel using WireGuard, which allows exposure from completely private networks.

---

### Is Wiredoor open-source?

Yes! Both the server and CLI are fully open source. You can self-host everything and have full control over your infrastructure.

---

### Can I use Wiredoor without a public domain?

Yes, but:

- You will receive a **self-signed SSL certificate**
- Browsers may show security warnings unless you manually trust the cert
- You won’t be able to use Let's Encrypt

---

### Can I expose multiple services on the same domain?

Yes. You can:

- Expose **multiple services on different paths** using HTTP (e.g., `/app1`, `/app2`)
- Or expose **different services on different subdomains** (e.g., `api.example.com`, `admin.example.com`)

---

### Can I run Wiredoor on a VPS?

Absolutely. In fact, a Linux VPS is the recommended environment for hosting the Wiredoor Server.

---

### Can I use Wiredoor in air-gapped environments?

Yes, if the node can **initiate outbound connections** to the Wiredoor Server (even via a proxy or firewall rule). However, features like Let's Encrypt won't work without internet access.

---

### Is there a limit to how many services I can expose?

No fixed limit. It depends on your server's capacity and how many ports or domains you configure.

---

### What happens if I restart the server or a node?

- The VPN tunnel will automatically reconnect
- Exposed services will be restored
- No manual reconfiguration is needed
