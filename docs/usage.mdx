# Using Wiredoor

Once Wiredoor Server is installed and running, you can start using the **Web UI** to configure domains, manage nodes, and expose services.

This guide walks you through the most common tasks you'll perform with Wiredoor.

---

## Domains

Domains are used to route traffic to your exposed services.

### Public Domains (Recommended)

- Should point to your Wiredoor server's public IP (use an A or CNAME DNS record)
- Enable automatic SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt
- Can be used to expose HTTP, TCP, or UDP services

### Internal or Local Domains

- Can be added even without a public DNS record (e.g. `local.service`, `test.app`)
- Will use **self-signed SSL certificates**
- Still support service exposure but will show browser warnings unless trusted

> ‚úÖ **Tip:** You can register as many domains as needed and map multiple services to each.

---

## Nodes

Nodes represent systems that connect to Wiredoor via WireGuard (clients or gateways).

When you create a node, Wiredoor will:

- Generate a unique **WireGuard peer config**
- Assign a static **VPN IP**
- Create an **API token** to use with `wiredoor-cli`

You can:

- üîÑ Connect or disconnect a node from the UI
- üîì Expose or hide services at any time
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configure a node as a **Gateway** to route traffic to its entire local subnet

### Gateway Nodes

If a node is marked as a **Gateway**, it acts like a site-to-site VPN. This means you can expose services from **any host** on the local network behind that node.

Use cases:
- Exposing devices on a LAN (IoT, cameras, servers)
- Bridging private Kubernetes clusters or Docker containers
- Accessing legacy infrastructure without deploying agents everywhere

---

## Exposing Services

Once a node is connected, you can expose services to the outside world.

### Types of Services

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **HTTP** | Standard web services (APIs, dashboards, UIs, etc.) |
| **TCP** | Custom services (databases, SSH, etc.) |
| **UDP** | Lightweight protocols (VoIP, game servers, etc.) |

You define:

- The **protocol** (HTTP, TCP, UDP)
- The **port** on the internal node or gateway
- The **domain name** and optionally a route/path
- Optional **IP/CIDR restrictions** for access control

Wiredoor handles:

- Routing traffic to the right node/service
- Terminating SSL (Let‚Äôs Encrypt or self-signed)
- Keeping the VPN tunnel alive

---

## Certificates

Wiredoor automatically provisions and renews SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt **if the domain is publicly resolvable**.

If not:

- A **self-signed certificate** will be generated instead
- Your browser may show a warning unless the cert is trusted

You can check certificate status and renewal from the Domains section.

## Example Use Cases

- Expose a local `Node-RED` instance running on a Raspberry Pi
- Publish a private Grafana dashboard from an on-prem server
- Access your Kubernetes API server remotely using the Gateway chart
- Route traffic to an internal device like a camera or PLC

## Next Steps

- Learn how to [connect your first node](./nodes.md)
- Use [`wiredoor-cli`](./cli.md) for automation and scripting
- Deploy a [Docker Gateway](./docker-gateway.md) or [Kubernetes Gateway](./kubernetes-gateway.md)
