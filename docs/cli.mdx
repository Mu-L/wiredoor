# Wiredoor CLI

`wiredoor-cli` is a lightweight command-line client written in Go, designed to interact with the Wiredoor Server.

It allows you to:

- Connect your node to the VPN
- Expose or unexpose services
- Check VPN status and connection logs
- Automate service exposure on boot
- Authenticate via token-based access

This CLI is especially useful for nodes running in headless environments (e.g., servers, containers, Raspberry Pi, etc.).

## Installation

Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/wiredoor/wiredoor-cli/releases) page

## Common Commands

### Login and Create Node

The fastest way to onboard a new system as a node.

```bash
wiredoor login --url https://your-wiredoor-instance-or-ip
```

- Prompts for your admin credentials (username/password)
- Prompts you to assign a name to the node. Defaults to the machine‚Äôs hostname.
- Retrieves and saves the node‚Äôs token to `/etc/wiredoor/config.ini`

### Connect to Wiredoor Node

Optionally you can connect to already created node:

```bash
wiredoor connect --url https://your-wiredoor-instance-or-ip --token YOUR_NODE_TOKEN
```

### Regenerate Access

Regenerates the current node‚Äôs **WireGuard** keys and **API token**:

```bash
wiredoor regenerate
```

Expected downtime: ~1-3 seconds

- Updates the remote config on the Wiredoor Server
- Replaces local config in `/etc/wiredoor/config.ini`
- Restarts the VPN connection with minimal downtime

### Expose TCP Services

Exposes the local TCP service running on port 1883 over Wiredoor

```bash
wiredoor tcp my-tcp-service --port 1883
```

Optional:

```bash
--proto udp           # Optional: change protocol (default: tcp)
--domain example.com  # Optional: set a domain (default: uses Wiredoor public IP)
--use-ssl             # Optional: enable SSL termination for TCP services
```

- Exposes the local service running on port 1883 over Wiredoor
- The public port is assigned automatically

### Expose HTTP Services

```bash
wiredoor http my-website --domain website.com --port 3000
```

Optional:

```bash
--path /ui     # Defaults to "/"
--proto https   # Defaults to "http"
```

- Exposes my-website running on http://localhost:3000 under https://website.com/
- Automatically enables SSL using Let's Encrypt (if the domain is public and resolves wiredoor IP, if not it uses self-signed certificates)

### Disable Public Access

```bash
wiredoor disable http my-website
```

Disables (but does not delete) the exposed service, making it inaccessible from outside.

### Enable Public Access

```bash
wiredoor enable http my-website
```

Re-enables a service that was previously disabled, without redefining it.

### Check status

Prints the current state

```bash
wiredoor status
```

- WireGuard tunnel status (connected/disconnected)
- Exposed services (name, protocol, port, domain, status)
- Node info (Name, VPN IP, connection time)

```text
 ‚úî WireGuard Connected
üñ•Ô∏è Node: my-hostname (10.0.0.4)
üåê Services:
- my-website [HTTP] ‚Üí https://website.com ‚Üí localhost:3000
```

### Disconnect 

```bash
wiredoor disconnect
```

Fully shuts down the VPN connection and marks the node as disconnected in the Web UI.

## Config File

After first login or connection, the CLI stores configuration under: `/etc/wiredoor/config.ini`

You can edit it manually or regenerate it by running `wiredoor login`, `wiredoor connect` or `wiredoor regenerate` again.
