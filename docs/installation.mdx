# Wiredoor Server Installation Guide

**Wiredoor Server is the entry point for all external traffic.** 
This means that the server's public IP address or domain **must be accessible from the internet**, 
or at least from the network where you want to access the exposed services.

Wiredoor is designed to run on a publicly reachable host so it can securely receive inbound traffic and forward it to your internal services over a private VPN tunnel.

## Deploying Wiredoor Server in Docker

This guide will walk you through installing **Wiredoor Server** using Docker. Wiredoor can run on any system that supports Docker, 
but we strongly recommend using a Linux VPS with public IP access for production use.

### Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- ✅ A Linux VPS or server (bare metal or cloud-based)
- ✅ Public IP address or domain name pointing to the server
- ✅ Open ports:
  - TCP: `80`, `443` — for HTTP and HTTPS traffic
  - UDP: `51820` — for WireGuard VPN (configurable)
  - Optional: a range of ports for exposing TCP services
- ✅ Installed:
  - [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  - (Optionally) [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Prepare persistent directories

Wiredoor needs directories to store configuration, data, and SSL certificates:

```bash copy
mkdir -p ~/{wiredoor-data,wiredoor-certbot,wiredoor-logs} && chown -R 1000:1000 ~/{wiredoor-data,wiredoor-certbot,wiredoor-logs}
```

### Create `docker-compose.yml`

Below is a minimal example for running Wiredoor:

```yaml filename="docker-compose.yml" copy
services:
  wiredoor:
    image: infladoor/wiredoor:latest
    container_name: wiredoor
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    environment:
      TZ: America/New_York                      # Set your timezone
      VPN_HOST: ${SERVER_PUBLIC_IP_OR_DOMAIN}   # Change This Value with your server IP or FQDN
      VPN_PORT: 51820                           # VPN Port 
      VPN_SUBNET: 10.12.1.0/24                  # VLAN Subnet For VPN Interface
      SERVER_CERTBOT_EMAIL: youremail@email.com # Email used to send notifications about certbot SSL certificates
#      TCP_SERVICES_PORT_RANGE: 32760-32767     # Optional Port range definition to expose TCP services if needed
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ~/wiredoor-data:/data
      - ~/wiredoor-certbot:/etc/letsencrypt
      # - ~/wiredoor-logs:/var/log/nginx        # <--- Optional: NGINX access logs, you can mount an additional volume to collect them
    ports:
      - 80:80/tcp
      - 443:443/tcp
      - 51820:51820/udp                         # Must match with VPN_PORT defined in environment
#      - 32760-32767                            # Must match with TCP_SERVICES_PORT_RANGE defined in environment
    sysctls:
      - net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  You can customize the port range and subnet as needed for your environment.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" emoji="🔐">
  For better security, you can define your environment variables in a `.env` file and reference them in your Docker Compose using `env_file: .env`. Be sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore`.
</Callout>

### Start Wiredoor

Run the following command to start the Wiredoor server:

```bash copy
docker compose up -d
```

Wiredoor will start and become available at: [https://SERVER_PUBLIC_IP_OR_DOMAIN](https://SERVER_PUBLIC_IP_OR_DOMAIN)

### Default login

Once started, access the web UI and log in using the default admin credentials printed in the container logs.

### Updating Wiredoor

You can update your Wiredoor instance at any time by pulling the latest image and recreating the container.

This process is also required **if you change the configuration in your `docker-compose.yml` file**, such as environment variables, volume paths, or exposed ports.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Exposed services may temporarily go offline during the restart (up to 2-3 minutes).
</Callout>

To update the Wiredoor image and apply config changes:

Download latest image:
```bash copy
docker compose pull wiredoor
```

Recreate wiredoor instance with latest image and config:
```bash copy
docker compose up -d wiredoor --force-recreate
```
