# Wiredoor Server Installation Guide

**Wiredoor Server is the entry point for all external traffic.** 
This means that the server's public IP address or domain **must be accessible from the internet**, 
or at least from the network where you want to access the exposed services.

Wiredoor is designed to run on a publicly reachable host so it can securely receive inbound traffic and forward it to your internal services over a private VPN tunnel.

## Deploying Wiredoor Server in Docker using Docker Compose

This guide will walk you through installing **Wiredoor Server** using Docker. Wiredoor can run on any system that supports Docker, 
but we strongly recommend using a Linux VPS with public IP access for production use.

### Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- ✅ A Linux VPS or server (bare metal or cloud-based)
- ✅ Public IP address or domain name pointing to the server
- ✅ Open ports:
  - TCP: `80`, `443` — for HTTP and HTTPS traffic
  - UDP: `51820` — for WireGuard VPN (configurable)
  - Optional: a range of ports for exposing TCP services
- ✅ Installed:
  - [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  - (Optionally) [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Project structure

```bash
wiredoor/
├── wiredoor-data/
├── wiredoor-certbot/
├── wiredoor-logs/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .env
```

### Prepare persistent directories

Wiredoor requires persistent directories to store configuration files, WireGuard keys, and SSL certificates.

Create the necessary folders and ensure proper permissions:

```bash copy
mkdir -p ./{wiredoor-data,wiredoor-certbot,wiredoor-logs} && chown -R 1000:1000 ./{wiredoor-data,wiredoor-certbot,wiredoor-logs}
```

### Config Environment variables in `.env`

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project to configure **Wiredoor** securely and flexibly, without hardcoding sensitive data into your `docker-compose.yml`.

```dotenv filename=".env" copy
# Wiredoor admin credentials
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com           # Required. Also used by certbot if SSL is enabled
ADMIN_PASSWORD=ChangeMe1st!             # Required. Use a secure password

# VPN Information
VPN_HOST=public_host_or_ip              # Required. Public address that clients will connect to
VPN_PORT=51820                          # Default WireGuard UDP port
VPN_SUBNET=10.0.0.0/24                  # Subnet for clients (in CIDR format)

# TCP Port range
TCP_SERVICES_PORT_RANGE=32760-32767     # Optional. Port range to expose TCP/UDP services

# TCP/UDP Exposure (Public Port Range)
TZ=America/New_York                     # Time zone (recommended for logging)
```

Check the [configuration documentation](/docs/configuration#environment-variables) for a full list of supported environment variables.

### Create `docker-compose.yml`

Below is a minimal example for running Wiredoor:

```yaml filename="docker-compose.yml" copy
services:
  wiredoor:
    image: ghcr.io/wiredoor/wiredoor:latest
    container_name: wiredoor
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    env_file:
      - .env
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ~/wiredoor-data:/data
      - ~/wiredoor-certbot:/etc/letsencrypt
      # - ~/wiredoor-logs:/var/log/nginx        # <--- Optional: Mount for collecting NGINX logs
    ports:
      - 80:80/tcp
      - 443:443/tcp
      - 51820:51820/udp                         # Must match with VPN_PORT in .env
#      - 32760-32767                            # Must match with TCP_SERVICES_PORT_RANGE in .env
    sysctls:
      - net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

  You can customize the port range and subnet as needed for your environment.

### Start Wiredoor

Once configured, simply start the service:

```bash copy
docker compose up -d
```

Wiredoor Interface will start and become available at: [https://SERVER_PUBLIC_IP_OR_DOMAIN](https://SERVER_PUBLIC_IP_OR_DOMAIN)

### Default login

Once started, access the web UI and log in using the admin credentials defined in `.env`.

### Updating Wiredoor

You can update your Wiredoor instance at any time by pulling the latest image and recreating the container.

This process is also required **when you make changes to your configuration** such as:

- Environment variables in `.env`
- Volume mount paths
- Exposed ports in `docker-compose.yml`

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  During the update, services exposed through Wiredoor may briefly go offline up to 2-3 minutes.
</Callout>

To update the Wiredoor image and apply config changes:

Pull the latest Wiredoor image:
```bash copy
docker compose pull wiredoor
```

Recreate the container with updated configuration:
```bash copy
docker compose up -d wiredoor --force-recreate
```

**Your data and configuration will persist in `wiredoor-data`, `wiredoor-certbot`, `wiredoor-logs` directories.**
